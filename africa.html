      Africa, the continent of extraordinary beauty with diverse cultures and majestic wildlife.  From the Nigerian savanna with wildlife and serene beaches with crystal-clear waters to the landscapes of Namibia's red dunes reflecting nature's grandeur, Africa also offers a spectrum of experiences, with over 3,000 ethnic groups and 2,000 languages. The wildebeest migration in Tanzania and Kenya, where millions of animals move in unison across the plains, National parks, and reserves showcasing predators in their natural habitat, painting a vivid portrait of a beautiful continent.

        However, beyond its magnificence lies a complex tapestry of economic challenges. With a population of over 1.2 billion people, the continent encompasses regions of prosperity and others impaired by poverty, hunger, disease, and violence. Reality emerges as over 41% of Africans survive on less than $1.90 a day, and a staggering 250 million endure chronic undernourishment. Education remains distant for many, with 59% of sub-Saharan African youth between the ages of 15 and 17 out of school, equating to nearly 6 out of 10 African teenagers lacking access to education. Moreover, over 770 million Africans lack access to electricity, and more than 75% are without internet connectivity.

        Despite the abundant natural resources that should be a source of wealth and prosperity, Africa grapples with persistently high poverty and economic inequality rates. The contrasting abundant resources and widespread poverty raise questions that demand answers<b>why is Africa poor?</b>  Is it the result of corruption and political instability, the legacy of colonization, the deficit in education, or perhaps deeply ingrained mentalities? This essay hopes to journey multiple issues that may have influenced African development.

  <div class="page2">  
    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">In Nigeria alone, an alarming statistic emerges – over 20 million teenagers are out of school. This issue stands as a significant impediment to Africa's overall development. Education, often dubbed the cornerstone of economic growth, job creation, and societal advancement, carries the power to transform lives. Without access to education, individuals face diminished prospects for employment, earning a sustainable income, and engaging actively in civic life.
    </p></div>
    
    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text"> 
      The predicament of education in Africa is deeply ingrained and plays a substantial role in perpetuating poverty on the continent. Education serves as a potent tool with the potential to disrupt the cycle of poverty by imparting knowledge, skills, and opportunities required for individuals to enhance their quality of life. Regrettably, when education is inaccessible or of subpar quality, it can transform from being a gateway to progress into a formidable obstacle. While the lack of education undoubtedly contributes to the economic challenges Africa faces, it, by itself, may not explain the continent's enduring poverty. A more holistic perspective is necessary to discern the intricate web of factors influencing Africa's economic difficulties.

    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">The #EndSARS protest in Nigeria is one we can beacon as an example of negligent governance in the political system. The peaceful protest started in October 2020, primarily as a response to police brutality, particularly by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian Police Force. On October 20, 2020, the Nigerian government ordered soldiers to open fire on the peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos. The incident, which left at least 12 people dead, and sparked outrage and condemnation from around the world.

        The ongoing conflict in Congo is another example of the influence of political unrest in the African continent. The weak and corrupt Congolese government is made up of several different factions, and these factions often compete for power and resources leading to geopolitics and ethnic rivalries. The inability of the government to provide basic services such as security, education, and healthcare has created a vacuum of several armed groups that can operate with impunity, thus contributing to the ongoing conflicts.

It persistently faces challenges in establishing effective institutions and systems that can address the needs of its diverse populations. since the continent gained independence. The cases of Nigeria and Congo underscore the deep-rooted issues of corruption, negligence, and political instability that plague many African nations. The broader issue of political instability in Africa is multifaceted. needed helpCorruption, fueled by a lack of transparency and accountability, erodes public trust and hampers development efforts. Additionally, borders often contribute to ethnic tensions and conflicts, as seen in various regions across the continent.

        I would love to end my essay here, as politics drastically impact a country. It can lead to loss of life, displacement of people, destruction of property, economic disruption, social unrest, human rights abuses, environmental damage, loss of cultural heritage, and increased risk of conflict. But more perspective is required to unravel the complexities of the continent's economic struggles.

  <div class="page4">  
    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">“We are Africans, we cannot be as good as the white people are is”, a vivid statement from my junior school teacher, when I asked why our school is not as impressive as those we watch in foreign movies. Instead of delving into economic or political factors, he gazed into my eyes and uttered the sentence that is in my head today. Africans, as a whole, tend to accept their place as an inferior continent, Why?

    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      European colonialism in Africa began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorers arrived on West Africa's shores, driven by the dual objectives of establishing new trade routes to Asia and spreading Christianity. Subsequently, the Dutch, French, and British joined the colonial race in the 17th century, sharing common goals of acquiring resources, setting up strategic trading posts, and expanding influence. 
    </p></div>
    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      The French set up trading posts in West Africa, particularly in Senegal, forming the foundation for later colonies in Senegal, Guinea, Ivory Coast, and more. The British, leveraging naval power, focused on resource-rich regions in West Africa, engaging in the transatlantic slave trade.
    </p></div>
    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      The 19th century saw an intensified scramble for Africa, culminating in the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, which formalized the division of Africa among European powers, creating arbitrary borders and contributing to long-lasting conflicts. Colonialism left lasting impacts, including resource exploitation, forced labor, and cultural assimilation. 
    </p></div>
    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      The legacy of colonial borders and governance structures continues to fuel the behavior of many Africans today. A Yoruba man would rather learn English than his native language “Yoruba” and a Togolese woman would rather learn French than her native language “Ewe” Traditions are dying, and cultures are been devalued, nothing done by our ancestors is considered right.

  <div class="page5">  
    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">A subjugated mentality is a toxic belief system imposed on a person by low information, inability to have free will, and mostly oppressive power. It induces a state of mind where one perceives themselves as lesser or inferior compared to others, resulting in diminished self-worth, confidence, and a lowered sense of personal value. When individuals internalize the idea that they are beneath others, they refrain from career or personal opportunities. This self-imposed limitation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believing they are unworthy, individuals may settle for less than they deserve, further restricting their options, and reinforcing the belief that they are indeed inferior. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">Political instability inflicts profound stress and diminishes citizens' self-worth. Lack of education, on the other hand, acts as a relentless impediment to progress, limiting one's perspective and the acquisition of new knowledge, hence not adapting to an ever-changing world.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">Furthermore, the historical devaluation of cultures and traditions by colonial powers has sowed the seeds of an inferiority complex among the colonized people. This complex often leads Africans to perceive their culture and way of life as inferior to that of their colonizers.

This is an intricate between the prevailing mindset and the economic hurdles that weave into the very essence of Africa's developmental landscape. The subjugated mentality propels a twirl in Africa's developmental trajectory. This insidious belief system, entrenched in historical oppression, educational gaps, and political instability, acts as a formidable barrier, limiting breaking the circle and impeding both individual potential and collective progress.

    <div class="page-box box1"><p class="page-text">Liberating the gyre requires self-awareness and profound exposure, diverse perspectives, and connections to the world at large. While the increasing exposure to the Internet in Africa has facilitated access to information and global discourse, it opens doors to diverse viewpoints, cultures, and knowledge, fostering a more interconnected and informed society. It has also fueled some recent noticeable changes in African cultural appreciation. From music, traditions, and food, Africa witnessed the highest global attention in its entertainment industry in the past quinquennia than it has in its history. and is a significant influence, in technology, exposure, politics, tourism, art, and fashion.

      Africa's transformation is an ongoing journey, by the growing self-realization among its people that they are not inherently disadvantaged in comparison to the rest of the world. This awakening has slowly shattered the shackles of ingrained self-limitation. Citizens are now pressing the need for thorough reforms in governance structures. Like,  the 2023 Nigerian election, recorded a remarkable shift of 37.2% of registered voters under the age of 35, a substantial increase from the 2019 election when only 27.8% fell within this age bracket. The youth's burgeoning engagement in politics signifies a change in perspective. The newfound attention to civic participation has transformed the political landscape, making it a responsibility for elected officials rather than a path to personal enrichment. <br>
      The political transformation in some parts of Africa has also influenced the recent developments across the continent:
  </p></div>

   
   
    <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      <b>Infrastructure Projects:</b> Africa is witnessing the construction of significant infrastructure developments. Examples include the Fourth Mainland Bridge in Nigeria, set to be the continent's longest bridge, and the Nnamdi Azikiwe Bridge in Nigeria, the longest cable-stayed bridge in Africa. Projects like the Henri Konan Bédié Bridge in Côte d'Ivoire and the Maputo-Catembe Bridge in Mozambique are enhancing connectivity, while the Bagamoyo Port in Tanzania and the New Capital City of Egypt are poised to redefine economic landscapes. Additionally, the Konza Technology City in Kenya is emerging as a hub for innovation and technology. <br>
      These projects are fostering economic growth, improving infrastructure, and attracting investment. Africa's average GDP growth rate has exceeded 3%, driven by population growth, urbanization, rising incomes, and increased stability.
     Also, Africa is a blessed continent with valuable assets like: <br>

 
     <b>Natural Resources:</b>  The continent boasts abundant mineral reserves, including diamonds, platinum, and cobalt, along with substantial oil, gas, forest, and water resources.
<br>

     <b>Human Resources: </b>  Africa's young population, with over 60% under the age of 25, represents a tremendous asset for economic growth and development. <br>


     <b>Cultural Resources:</b>  With over 3,000 ethnic groups, each rich in unique language, culture, and traditions, Africa's cultural diversity is a source of strength, offering opportunities for tourism, economic development, and social cohesion. <br>
     And when these resources are utilized they will contribute to the ongoing development. 

     <div class="page-box box3">
    <p class="page-text">
      The challenges faced in Africa are undeniable, the roads are bad, children are out of school, and social and political conflicts are still pressing issues but the spirit of resilience and determination burns brightly within its people. As Africa sheds the shackles of its past and embraces its own unique identity, it stands poised for its transformative incline.
      The journey ahead will not be without its hurdles. Yet, Africa's progress is inevitable, fueled by its vibrant youth, its rich cultural heritage, and its vast untapped resources.
      The time has come when we're Africans and begin to accept themselves for its diversity, traditions, and cultural involvement, where its people can flourish and contributions can enrich the global community.
      As Africa refrain the turning of its subjugated mentality and embraces its inner strength, it will not only transform itself but also inspire others around the world. The continent's ascent will not just be a story of economic growth and development but also a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people.
      The future of Africa is bright, illuminated by the collective aspirations of its people. Together, we will shape our destiny, crafting a legacy of progress, prosperity, and unity that will reverberate for generations.
