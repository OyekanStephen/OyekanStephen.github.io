            Are you just like me? Born in a Christian family, going to church with your family, but constantly questioning, "Is there really a God?" If there is no God, then how did the universe come into existence? Is my faith even real? After reading countless research, still haven't been able to find a definitive answer. Well, I'm writing this because I can relate to this struggle 
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            Psalm 1:1-3 reads as follows: <br>
            (1) Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, (2) but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his Law Day and night. (3) That person will be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season whatever he doth shall prosper.

            Well, I tried that. I read the Bible daily, pray to God, never miss church, and try to be as holy as possible, just as the Bible says. I can confirm, it works like magic. Everything started going right, and I would receive everything I prayed for. I felt a deep connection to God's love and could even hear God speaking to me. The more devoted I became, the closer I felt to God. But does this prove God's existence
        </p>

        <p class="page-text">
            Yes, for the moment i place all my beliefs in the Bible, and God comes into existence for me. I call this theory (I don't even know what to call it, just give it any name) the more belief you place in anything, the truer it becomes. I think this is how the universe works. If you hold a theory or belief strongly enough, everything seems to align to make it true. There are millions of religions in the world, and none of them is wrong. The more devoted you are, the more that religion comes into existence.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            Belief possesses remarkable power that can shape one's reality. It acts as a potent force that influences thoughts, actions, and perceptions. When one embraces a particular belief or conviction, it becomes a lens through which the world is viewed. Belief can enable the manifestation of dreams and goals. Moreover, belief can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, as our thoughts and expectations often shape our behaviors and the outcomes we experience. Belief is a catalyst that can mold our reality. Even not believing in religion is a form of religion itself. It's like a competition to determine which belief is right when in reality, none can be wrong. 
        </p>

            I wrote this research because I wasn't able to find a definitive yes or no answer in all the research I read. I am going to provide you with the answer you seek. Ask yourself what you believe in. Is it Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Judaism, or do you simply not believe in any religion? You may wonder if you are wrong. The straightforward answer is that you are not wrong. Regardless of the religion you believe in, it works on the same principle stated above. Neither you nor I can ever be wrong.
        </p>

            Yeah, I know, I’ve still not answered your question. Does God exist?  With the physical evidence, we have like universes, planets, and lives. This is enough to convince us that the universe is beautifully and precisely made. Whatever ignited the famous big bang theory or any form of energy that influenced the creation of the universe is God. So yes, there is God, just not in the religious way we’ve always perceived it.
